Steps:
 1)Launch the Control Node and Managed Nodes.
 2)Create Newuser like User Name (ansadminnijam) & across all server and provide with password.
 3)Give Sudo User asccess for ansadminnijam (visudo)
    [UserName] ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
    eg: ansadminnijam ALL=(ALL:ALL)  ALL

 4)Make Sure that PasswordAuthentication Yes (enable by default NO) in all server and restart with sshd services
     -/etc/ssh/sshd_config
 5)Generate ssh-keys using ssh-keygen cmd for new users(ansadminnijam)	 
 6)copy SSh publick key using ssh-copy-id <hostname>
    -ssh-copy-id -i </home/ansadmin/.ssh/id_rsa.pub> ansadmin@ipaddress
7)Now login to remote server without providing password 
     ssh ipaddress
8)Ansible Engine uses SSH Connection to connect and work with manage nodes;
9) We can create SSH Connection two ways
   -PasswordAuthentication
   -Password-less Authentication   
10) Provide the manage node using IP/FQDN in invontery file on Ansible Engine. It will present in  /etc/ansible.

11) Group a Node into invetory and ping a module you will got a response.     
     Simple test ansible all -m ping
